# Page replacement Algorithms in C

Simulation of common memory page replacement algorithms done by the OS, implemented in C

## Getting Started

You will need to compile the source files for whichever algorithms you want to run, then enter the input file through the stdin of the compiled program.
[Compile and run C using gcc (ubuntu)](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/CAN_e14/Readings/How%20to%20Compile%20and%20Run%20a%20C%20Program%20on%20Ubuntu%20Linux.pdf)

### Implemented algorithms

- [FIFO](https://github.com/AbdullahKady/page-replacement-algorithms/blob/master/src/FIFO.c) - First In First Out.
- [2nd chance](https://github.com/AbdullahKady/page-replacement-algorithms/blob/master/src/second-chance.c)
